<h1>The many hobbies and interests of Annisa</h1>

<section>
<h2><u><b>Hobbies & Interests</b></u></h2>
<p>
Basically, anything sporty and outdoors. It's a wide brush stroke, but here are a few:

<ul>
<li>Hiking & Camping</i>.</li>
<li>Competitive clays</li>
<li>Motorcycle and bicycle riding</li>
<li>Playing competitive sports</li>
<li>Reading</li>
<li>Traveling</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2><u><i>Future Travel Plans</i></u></h2>
<p>
Since most of the hobbies and interests can be completed when time is available, I don't always plan out hobby and interest time, except when it comes to travel. Below is a list of place I would like to travel in the next year.
<ul>
<li>Harry Potter World in Orlando, FL <sup>scheduled for November of 2019</sup></li>
<li>The Bahamas <sup>scheduled for June of 2020</sup></li>
<li>England <sup>not yet scheduled</sup></li>
</ul>
